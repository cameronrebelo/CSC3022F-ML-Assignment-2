RBLCAM001 - ML ASSIGNMENT 2

The 3 scenarios are kept in the src folder. By default the scenarios 
will run one iteration of a 20 epoch agent. This can be changed by changing 
the range of the iteration loop. The outputs for the paths will be stored in their
respective folder in the data directory.

src/Scenario1
    Simple Four Rooms with one package, will take -stochastic as CLI to make the scenario
    operate in a stochastic environment, by default the environment is deterministic.

src/Scenario2
    Multi Four Rooms with many packages, will take -stochastic as CLI to make the scenario
    operate in a stochastic environment, by default the environment is deterministic.

src/Scenario3
    Multi Four Rooms with RGB packages that have a specific order, will take -stochastic 
    as CLI to make the scenario operate in a stochastic environment, by default the environment is deterministic.
